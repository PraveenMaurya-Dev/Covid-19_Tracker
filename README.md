# Covid-19_Tracker
The main objective is to monitoring the pandemic at global level as well as state level. We are using API available on api.covid19india.org and  
state bulletins and official handles to update our numbers. Then we have  used python flask to fetch data from API and for body design we have 
used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, & FLASK FRAMEWORK. For designing we have created a dynamic graph where we use flourish studio. And for deployment we have use Heroku. 
We have tried to keep it UI simple.
